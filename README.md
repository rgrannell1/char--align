## Installation

You can install S-Align in several ways. The easiest is by installing [Sublime Package Manager](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)
and then:

* 1, Press <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + p</kbd>, and navigate to 'add repository'
* 2, Drop the URL for this package - https://github.com/rgrannell1/s-align - into the text field.
* 3, Now press <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + p</kbd>, navigate to 'install package', and type 's-align'.
